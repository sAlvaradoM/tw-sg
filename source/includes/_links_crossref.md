# Links and Cross-References 

Links and cross-references can help you expand on the topic and make your document navigable. 

**Links** allow you to refer to additional information in the outside sources. 

**Cross-references** are used to navigate through different points within the document, they also help you avoid duplication.

## Links in the Beginning of a Chapter or a Section
It is a _must_ to have links for the subsections in the beginning of the chapter or a document. This is because it serves the following purposes:

- Tells the reader that you are going to explain these tasks in detail down the line.
- Prevents the reader from scrolling unnecessarily through the document.
Suppose, the reader knows about three tasks, but not much about the fourth, then they can directly land up at that task without having to scroll unnecessarily through a bunch of pages.
- Fulfills the requirements of Accessibility. 

The same rules apply to long sections. If your section is short and has subsections, but ends on the same page where it was started, then you do not need to have links to the subsections. However if your section is long, then you need to provide links for the subsection, so that readers can “jump” to the section they really need.

Do _not_ use the words “this link” to refer to an external link. It does not give a clear indication to the user whether the link is to a section in the same chapter, same guide, or same library, unless the user brings the cursor to the link. Also, links must always be indicative where you are leading the reader to.

For example:

## Guidelines for Using Cross-References
 
Here are quick guidelines for creating cross-references:

* **Cross-references to other chapters and sections in the same guide:**
  - **Cross-reference to another section in the same chapter:**
   <br>For more information on \<topic>, see section, “<hyperlink/to/section_name>”.
<br>For example:
For more information on creating and managing server instances, see section, “<ins>Managing Instances</ins>”.


  - **Cross-reference to another chapter:**
  <br>For more information on \<topic>, see Chapter 1, “<hyperlink/to/chapter_name>”.
For example:
For more information on creating and managing server instances, see Chapter 6, “<ins>Managing Instances</ins>”.


   - **Cross-reference to a section in another chapter:**
For more information on \<topic>, see section, “<hyperlink/to/section_name>” in Chapter 1.
<br>For example:
<br>For more information on creating and managing server instances, see section, “<ins>Managing Instances</ins>”, in Chapter 6.


* **Cross-references to tables:**
<br>For more information on \<topic>, see <hyperlink/to/Table_number>.
<br>For example:
<br>For more information on parameters to use while creating and managing server instances, see <ins>Table 17</ins>.


* **Cross-references to figures:**
<br>For more information on \<topic>, see <hyperlink/to/Figure_number>.
<br> For example:
<br> For more information on components of server instances, see <ins>Figure 29</ins>.


* **Cross-references to external links:**
Use one of the following methods to specify a link:


  - For more information about \<topic>, see <hyperlink/to/the/site>.

    <br>For example:
    For more information about Docker bridge networks, see Use <ins>Bridge Networks in Docker </ins>.
   <br>OR

   - For more information on \<topic>, see the following link:
<hyperlink/to/the/site>.

    <br>For example:
  <br>For an exhaustive list of British versus American spellings, see the following link:
   http://tysto.com/uk-us-spelling-list.html	

  OR

  See the following link for more information on <topic_hyperlink/to/the/site>:

  For example:

  See an <ins>exhaustive list of British versus American spellings for more information</ins>.
